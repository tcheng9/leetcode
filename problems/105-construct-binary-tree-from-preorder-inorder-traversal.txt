I. Conceptual Solution
-----------------------------------------------
2 facts to remember:
a. First value in preorder is always the root
b. First value in inorder is always the left node

Q: so what happens when you see an already visited node in the opposite list 
Every value of the left of the ROOT node (you have to find out from preorder) 
    -> is on the left side of the tree. Every value of the root node is on the right side
    -> SO YOU CAN PARTITION Preorder

Q: So from the partitions, how do you build the left side of the tree but further down it has a left and right child node?
A: Once you are done doing the traversal from the given 
node that splits left and right, preorder and inorder will be at the same index ->
as a result, you can use the ame methodology as above to identify:
    - the next BRANCH split from the inorder traversal (using the preorder traversal to identify the root node)
    - the
