Conceptual solution 1:
1. compare start and end letters -> 2 pointer solution


Questions: 
1. How to check for alphanumeric characters?
ANSWER: for alpabetic characters, you can use ord()
for numeric characters, you can 
2. how to make value lowercase? 
ANSWER: str.lower() -> make the whole string lowercase
3. How to skip non-alphanumeric numbers?
if the letter is not within the lowercase bounds OR numbers bound, l or r +1




Edgecases:
1. all lowercase
2. all uppercase
3. all numbers
4. all non-alphanumeric values
5. No values -> palindrome or not a palindrome?

Steps:
1. init left pointer
2. init right pointer
3. while l < r THEN check condition
4. if it is a number or or lowercase, check if ord(l) == ord(r)
5. if l or r is not within the bounds THEN you skip l or r + 1
6. IF l != r:
    a. return false

7. if while loop terminates (l >r ):
    a. return true


    ALPHANUMERIC CHECK:
    
Improvmeent:
1. should have done a for loop to convert it into a single string of letters
2. 


Things I learned:
1. str.lower() -> turns an entire string to lower case IGNORING symbols and numbers
NOTE: not in place, need to set to a new var
2. I should try to figure out the core parts of a solution then code the core piece by piece:
    ANSWER: I should have
